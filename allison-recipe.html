    <h1 class="title">Vegan Winter Stew (with Dumplings!)</h1>
        <p class="intro">Below is one of my absolutely favorite recipes 
        to make in the colder months that are coming
        upon us. As the leaves start to change and every being starts 
        to forage and hibernate, preparing this 
        hearty soup certainly feel right. Below you will see a list of both the ingredients you need for the stew and
        for the dumplings.

                First we will make a lower-fat roux. Preheat a large, 
                heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat. Add the oil and sprinkle
                in the flour. Use a slanted wooden spatual to stir pretty 
                consistently for 3 to 4 minutes, until the flour is clumpy
                and toasty. Add the onion and the salt, adn toss to coat 
                the onions completely in the flour mixture. Cook for five 
                minute, stirring often. Add the garlic and stir for about 
                30 more seconds. Stream in the broth, whisking constantly 
                to prevent clumping. Add the celery, potatoes, carrots, dill, 
                thyme, paprika, and black pepper, then turn teh heat up and 
                cover to bring to a boil. Keep close eye on it and stir often 
                so that it doesn't clump or boil over. 
                Once boiling, lower the heat to simmer and ley cook uncovered 
                for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasioanlly, until the stew is 
                nicely thickened and the potatoes and carrots are tender. 
                </p>

                Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                Mix in the rosemary. Make a well in the center and add the milk 
                and olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to mix together until a
                wet dough forms. When the stew is ready, mix in teh beans and 
                plop spoonfuls of dough right on top of the stew. You should 
                get about 14 dumplings. Cover the pot tightly and cook for about 
                14 more minutes. The dumplings should be nice and firm.
                Use your ladle to dunk them into the stew to coat them.
                Ladle the ste winto bowls, and top with the dumplings. Garnish 
                with additional herbs and serve.
