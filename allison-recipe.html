        <li>3/4 Soy or Almong Milk</li>
        <li>2 TB Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
<p>
<h4>Prepare the Stew!</h4>
First we will make a lower-fat roux. Preheat a large, heavy-bottom pot over medium-high heat. Add the oil and sprinkle
in the flour. Use a slanted wooden spatual to stir pretty consistently for 3 to 4 minutes, until the flour is clumpy
and toasty. Add the onion and the salt, adn toss to coat the onions completely in the flour mixture. Cook for five minute, stirring
often. Add the garlic and stir for about 30 more seconds. 
Stream in the broth, whisking constantly to prevent clumping. Add the celery, potatoes, carrots, dill, thyme, paprika, and black pepper, 
then turn teh heat up and cover to bring to a boil. Keep close eye on it and stir often so that it doesn't clump or boil over. 
Once boiling, lower the heat to simmer and ley cook uncovered for 20 to 25 minutes, stirring occasioanlly, until the stew is 
nicely thickened and the potatoes and carrots are tender.

<h4>Prepare the Dumplings!</h4>
<p>
    Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in the rosemary. Make a well in the center and add the milk and olive oil. Use a wooden spoon to mix together until a
    wet dough forms. 
    When the stew is ready, mix in teh beans and plop spoonfuls of dough right on top of the stew. You should get about 14 dumplings. Cover the pot tightly and cook for about 14 more minutes. The dumplings should be nice and firm.
    Use your ladle to dunk them into the stew to coat them.
    Ladle the ste winto bowls, and top with the dumplings. Garnish with additional herbs and serve.
