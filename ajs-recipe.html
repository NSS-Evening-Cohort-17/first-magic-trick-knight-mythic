            <p>This chocolate cake with buttermilk icing brings something to the table for everyone.
                It has a rich, chocolatey flavor that is great for chocolate lovers - balanced by a light buttermilk icing.
                Its a moist, spongy cake that is hard to put down!

                When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make this cake every year for my birthday, and its still my favorite cake to this day.
                I have fond memories of making it with her at her house around the holidays.  I knew it as "grandma's cake", but everyone else in my family knew it as "Asher's favorite cake."
                
                Hopefully you can share in this wonderful recipe with your loved ones too. :)
